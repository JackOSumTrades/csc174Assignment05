			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>I’m a senior at the University of Rochester studying Political Science with a minor in Computer Science. Outside of class, I’m a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon and a Speaking Fellow. I enjoy aviation and programming in my spare time.</p>

			<h3>Courses</h3>
				<p>I’ve taken a lot of courses (almost enough to graduate!) while at the U of R. One of my favorites was my first political science course, Game Theory. The course certainly wasn’t fun and games, but it did include a lot of interesting concepts such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and other formalizations of problems. The entire course was focused on how decisions should be made when those decisions are dependent on other parties’ decisions. Another interesting course I took was called Research Practicum in Criminal Justice Reform. This course was much easier than Game Theory, but I learned a lot of practical knowledge from it. The course was partnered with a non-profit called Measures for Justice, and students were able to gain experience reading legal statutes and gathering data-- this would eventually be used by MFJ as part of their database intended to showcase data and abnormalities across county-level criminal justice systems.</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>I’ve had a couple different jobs throughout college. The first, after my freshman year of college, ties into one of my biggest passions: Soaring. I spent the summer as a commercial glider pilot, flying passenger rides in small, unpowered aircraft. After returning to school for sophomore year, I got a job as a Speaking Fellow. This involved taking a 4-credit course in the spring semester, which I viewed as an opportunity to learn more about and grow my experience in public speaking. I’ve been doing this job for almost two years now, and I’ve learned a lot! The following summer I bounced around; I started as an Orientation Leader in the orientation program. While this was an interesting position that allowed for a lot of creativity, it wasn’t the best fit for me. I ended up leaving the position in favor of one as an Emergency Medical Technician for the remainder of the summer. I enjoyed this job as it was always something new, and incredibly hands-on. Following my Junior year, I took a part-time position/internship with the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Rochester, helping them conduct research and analyze data in order to make informed policy decisions. Who knows what I’ll do next!</p>

			<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p>I’d also like to take some time to talk about Soaring. Soaring is one of my biggest passions -- it’s the sport of flying, and sometimes racing, unpowered aircraft. I first began soaring during my junior year of high school, and quickly fell in love. I learned about how a glider stays in the air for extended periods: getting pushed up by circling in rising air currents; and how they takeoff and land: being towed up by a powered airplane, and gliding in for a landing. I was able to earn my Private Pilot Glider rating the summer before my freshman year, and my Commercial rating the following summer. I’m currently working on my Flight Instructor rating, and I can’t wait to be able to teach new pilots.</p>
