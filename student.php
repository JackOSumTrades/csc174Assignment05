				<p>I took many interesting courses in computer science. I started from the beginning, taking “The
					Science of
					Programming”, The University of Rochester’s introduction class to computer science. Since then, I’ve
					taken many
					classes and even took more classes than were required for the major. A few notable ones are
					“Operating Systems”,
					Advanced Algorithms”, “Web Development”, and “Android Development”; in these classes, I’ve learned
					many concepts
					and techniques important to being a software engineer. I also have been a Workshop Leader/ Teaching
					Assistant
					beginning my second semester of college. I led workshops for “The Science of Programming” and then
					“Data
					Structures and Algorithms”. </p>

				<h3 class="russo">Work Experience</h3>
				<p>I’ve worked a few jobs relating to computer science. I founded a startup called Change, there, I was
					CTO and Lead
					Software Engineer leading 3 other developers. The purpose of the startup was to connect donors and
					volunteers to
					student groups and charities in the Rochester area. We received first-round funding from the
					National Science
					Foundation and were a featured startup in the NextCorps Incubator. I also had an internship last
					summer as a
					Software Development Engineer at Remitly, an international money transfer company based in Seattle.
					I worked as
					a full-stack developer in the Global Product Team, working to ease customer use and better their
					experiences.

				<p>I thought that the BS program in the University of Rochester is quite challenging as I struggled
					through
					many of the core courses, most notably CSC 282 and 252. However, I have fortunately gotten through
					all of
					them and only need one more 200 level course to graduate and have decided to take CSC 261 as this
					final
					course. For my advanced CS course electives, I decided to concentrate on web and mobile programming
					as I’ve
					taken CSC 210 and 214. In addition to these courses, I have also taken CSC 170, CSC 172, and
					currently
					taking CSC 174.</p>

				<h3 class="russo">Work Experience</h3>
				<p>When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of
					different jobs such as yogurt, smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching.
					Two
					summers ago I worked at ClassLink as a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a
					pleasant
					experience as I did not have much mentorship. The experience was so awful that I thought I would
					hate the
					software engineering industry. Last summer, I worked at Ellucian as a Software Developer Intern.
					Thankfully
					in this second internship, I had a very solid mentorship as it was a much bigger company and had a
					very
					enriching and invaluable experience.</p>

				<p>I’ve taken a lot of courses (almost enough to graduate!) while at the U of R. One of my favorites was
					my
					first political science course, Game Theory. The course certainly wasn’t fun and games, but it did
					include a
					lot of interesting concepts such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and other formalizations of problems. The
					entire
					course was focused on how decisions should be made when those decisions are dependent on other
					parties’
					decisions. Another interesting course I took was called Research Practicum in Criminal Justice
					Reform. This
					course was much easier than Game Theory, but I learned a lot of practical knowledge from it.

				<h3 class="play-fair">Work Experience</h3>
				<p>I’ve had a couple different jobs throughout college. The first, after my freshman year of college,
					ties into
					one of my biggest passions: Soaring. I spent the summer as a commercial glider pilot, flying
					passenger rides
					in small, unpowered aircraft. After returning to school for sophomore year, I got a job as a
					Speaking
					Fellow. This involved taking a 4-credit course in the spring semester, which I viewed as an
					opportunity to
					learn more about and grow my experience in public speaking. I’ve been doing this job for almost two
					years
					now, and I’ve learned a lot! The following summer I bounced around; I started as an Orientation
					Leader in
					the orientation program.
