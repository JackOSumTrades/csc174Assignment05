				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester. I’m majoring in Computer Science and plan to graduate this May with a Bachelor of Science. I have a passion for transforming innovative ideas to seamless and elegant web applications.</p>

				<h3>Courses</h3>
				<p>I thought that the BS program in the University of Rochester is quite challenging as I struggled through
					many of the core courses, most notably CSC 282 and 252. However, I have fortunately gotten through all of
					them and only need one more 200 level course to graduate and have decided to take CSC 261 as this final
					course. For my advanced CS course electives, I decided to concentrate on web and mobile programming as I’ve
					taken CSC 210 and 214. In addition to these courses, I have also taken CSC 170, CSC 172, and currently
					taking CSC 174</p>

				<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of
					different jobs such as yogurt, smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching. Two
					summers ago I worked at ClassLink as a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a pleasant
					experience as I did not have much mentorship. The experience was so awful that I thought I would hate the
					software engineering industry. Last summer, I worked at Ellucian as a Software Developer Intern. Thankfully
					in this second internship, I had a very solid mentorship as it was a much bigger company and had a very
					enriching and invaluable experience.</p>

				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p>I grew up mostly in Bergen County, NJ, especially within
					the Korean-American enclave of Palisades Park. Growing up I was always fascinated by computers and how they
					worked. I remember milestones like the process of installing my first graphics card, and learning how to mod
					video games.</p>
