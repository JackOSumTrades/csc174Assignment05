			<h3>Courses</h3>
				<p>I took many interesting courses in computer science. I started from the beginning, taking “The Science of
					Programming”, The University of Rochester’s introduction class to computer science. Since then, I’ve taken many
					classes and even took more classes than were required for the major. A few notable ones are “Operating Systems”,
					Advanced Algorithms”, “Web Development”, and “Android Development”; in these classes, I’ve learned many concepts
					and techniques important to being a software engineer. I also have been a Workshop Leader/ Teaching Assistant
					beginning my second semester of college. I led workshops for “The Science of Programming” and then “Data
					Structures and Algorithms”. Later in my academic career, I became a Teaching Assistant for “Computer
					Organization”.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>I’ve worked a few jobs relating to computer science. I founded a startup called Change, there, I was CTO and Lead
					Software Engineer leading 3 other developers. The purpose of the startup was to connect donors and volunteers to
					student groups and charities in the Rochester area. We received first-round funding from the National Science
					Foundation and were a featured startup in the NextCorps Incubator. I also had an internship last summer as a
					Software Development Engineer at Remitly, an international money transfer company based in Seattle. I worked as
					a full-stack developer in the Global Product Team, working to ease customer use and better their experiences. My
					project, specifically, was to create a service for receivers of the money transfer to live track the money. This
					project involved building the front end for the user to see, the database interaction to get the data, and
					everything in between. I will be returning to the same team as a full-time engineer upon graduation.</p>

			<h3>Courses</h3>
				<p>I thought that the BS program in the University of Rochester is quite challenging as I struggled through
				many of the core courses, most notably CSC 282 and 252. However, I have fortunately gotten through all of
				them and only need one more 200 level course to graduate and have decided to take CSC 261 as this final
				course. For my advanced CS course electives, I decided to concentrate on web and mobile programming as I’ve
				taken CSC 210 and 214. In addition to these courses, I have also taken CSC 170, CSC 172, and currently
				taking CSC 174.</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			 <p>When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of
				different jobs such as yogurt, smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching. Two
				summers ago I worked at ClassLink as a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a pleasant
				experience as I did not have much mentorship. The experience was so awful that I thought I would hate the
				software engineering industry. Last summer, I worked at Ellucian as a Software Developer Intern. Thankfully
				in this second internship, I had a very solid mentorship as it was a much bigger company and had a very
				enriching and invaluable experience.</p>

			<h3>Courses</h3>
				<p>I’ve taken a lot of courses (almost enough to graduate!) while at the U of R. One of my favorites was my
				first political science course, Game Theory. The course certainly wasn’t fun and games, but it did include a
				lot of interesting concepts such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and other formalizations of problems. The entire
				course was focused on how decisions should be made when those decisions are dependent on other parties’
				decisions. Another interesting course I took was called Research Practicum in Criminal Justice Reform. This
				course was much easier than Game Theory, but I learned a lot of practical knowledge from it. The course was
				partnered with a non-profit called Measures for Justice, and students were able to gain experience reading
				legal statutes and gathering data-- this would eventually be used by MFJ as part of their database intended
				to showcase data and abnormalities across county-level criminal justice systems.</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>I’ve had a couple different jobs throughout college. The first, after my freshman year of college, ties into
				one of my biggest passions: Soaring. I spent the summer as a commercial glider pilot, flying passenger rides
				in small, unpowered aircraft. After returning to school for sophomore year, I got a job as a Speaking
				Fellow. This involved taking a 4-credit course in the spring semester, which I viewed as an opportunity to
				learn more about and grow my experience in public speaking. I’ve been doing this job for almost two years
				now, and I’ve learned a lot! The following summer I bounced around; I started as an Orientation Leader in
				the orientation program. While this was an interesting position that allowed for a lot of creativity, it
				wasn’t the best fit for me. I ended up leaving the position in favor of one as an Emergency Medical
				Technician for the remainder of the summer. I enjoyed this job as it was always something new, and
				incredibly hands-on. Following my Junior year, I took a part-time position/internship with the Consumer
				Credit Counseling Service of Rochester, helping them conduct research and analyze data in order to make
				informed policy decisions. Who knows what I’ll do next!</p>
