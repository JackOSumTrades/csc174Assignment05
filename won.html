			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester. I’m majoring in Computer Science and plan to graduate this May with a Bachelor of Science. I have a passion for transforming innovative ideas to seamless and elegant web applications.</p>

			<h3>Courses</h3>
				<p>I thought that the BS program in the University of Rochester is quite challenging as I struggled through
            	many of the core courses, most notably CSC 282 and 252. However, I have fortunately gotten through all of
            	them and only need one more 200 level course to graduate and have decided to take CSC 261 as this final
            	course. For my advanced CS course electives, I decided to concentrate on web and mobile programming as I’ve
            	taken CSC 210 and 214. In addition to these courses, I have also taken CSC 170, CSC 172, and currently taking CSC 174</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of
            	different jobs such as yogurt, smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching. Two summers ago I worked at ClassLink as a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a pleasant experience as I did not have much mentorship. The experience was so awful that I thought I would hate the software engineering industry. Last summer, I worked at Ellucian as a Software Developer Intern. Thankfully in this second internship, I had a very solid mentorship as it was a much bigger company and had a very enriching and invaluable experience.</p>

			<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p>I grew up mostly in Bergen County, NJ, especially within
    			the Korean-American enclave of Palisades Park. Growing up I was always fascinated by computers and how they worked. I remember milestones like the process of installing my first graphics card, and learning how to mod video games.</p>
